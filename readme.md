# LeetBeans

This is LeetCode for Java developers using Maven and IntelliJ

- We utilize IntelliJ's debugger to step through each solution
- This allows us to visualize each step of an algorithm
- We use Maven to easily install helpful testing libraries like JUnit and Hamcrest

# Why Beans?
- Most solutions are in Python and JavaScript
- While there's nothing wrong with those languages, people who code in Java are left sad :(
- Be sad no longer my fellow Javonians
